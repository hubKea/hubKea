- 👋 Hi, I’m @hubKea  
- 👀 I’m interested in UX design, business analysis, and creating innovative technology solutions that drive impact.  
- 🌱 I’m currently in my second year of BSc Informatics, learning about the intersection of technology, business, and user experience.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that merge business strategy with technology to improve user experiences and solve complex problems.  
-  How to reach me: keamomari@gmail.com  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I taught myself UX design through countless YouTube tutorials and trial-and-error projects—thankfully, those first attempts will never see the light of day!
